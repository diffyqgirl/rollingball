Ongoing work on a Unity game that began as a CS50 class project.

The goal of the game is to collect all the green cubes as quickly as possible while falling off the world as few times as possible. Careful--the landscape moves around. Spiked balls will chase the player, and bombs will explode if you roll over them. Different surfaces behave differently--movement on ice is not the same as movement on sand. Move with arrow keys, jump with spacebar.

Current plans include improving how I model friction on ice, fixing the bugs to the skybox that were introduced when unity forced an upgrade on me, and tweaking the camera to stop behaving weirdly when you back up aggressively, and fixing the strange behaviour that occasionally allows the user to double jump. 

Another ongoing project is to expand the game to include areas where gravity behaves unexpectedly.
